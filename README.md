# crystallizationSimulation
A MATLAB simulation of crystal nucleation and growth

Created in MATLAB R2016a


crystallizationSimulationPortal_pub.m is provided as a convenience for performing the simulation with the helper functions. First load the MATLAB variable file 'fit_nucDens.mat' that gives you the key to converting temperature to nucleation density (unless you want to simulate something with a different nucleation density).
